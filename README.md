# ReactDesktop
Practicing with React. Making a React app similar to my JsDesktop.

Used a dummy key/cert pair for now to keep it in HTTPS (must force browser to accept).

Two paths can be used for now: the root '/' and '/subapp'.

Initially runs on port '4000' (can be changed in 'src/config/conf.ts).

Better use 'npm run watch' for 'nodemon' re-run (but 'build', 'build-server', 'build-client', and 'start' are also available).
